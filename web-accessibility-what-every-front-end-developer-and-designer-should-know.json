What every Front-end developer and designer should know.","description":"The topic of web accessibility is constantly drawing my attention. As a front-end developer, I've always been curious about how to make the interface as simple and straightforward as possible. I remember, as a student, I added event listeners to keyboard shortcuts to make it easier and faster to navigate my first web pages. So the scope of accessibility echoed within me when I found out what the concept meant. In this article I want to collect documents and briefly describe what accessibility is, why and to whom it is needed, as well as share my approach to developing and testing available interfaces. The material will be useful for both Front-end developers and designers, as well as anyone who uses the Internet.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"assets/content/blog/web-accessibility-what-every-front-end-developer-and-designer-should-know.json","sha":"ce745be06862b19f48fbcf12cfa0d779d567f060"},"files":[{"path":"/static/img/accecebility.jpg","sha":"696b00e99987eabaa9ec5e57c7515ac9abf2532b"},{"path":"/static/img/image16_wmql5hf.jpg","sha":"480e6afb3ecd07f7eb7ec4b8aaf7fefefe90b5c7"},{"path":"/static/img/image5_jugc7z4.png","sha":"dd8bb8ad02f05f760caa4e3334bb944328f383d9"}]},"timeStamp":"2019-12-15T17:18:23.430Z"}
